# Neuromorphic-Ultrasonic-Active-Acoustic-Sensing

*Brief Description:** The project aimed to create a simulated sensing system modeled after the highly efficient echolocation of the horseshoe bat. The system implemented a real-time insect classification system using an LSTM network on a dual-core H7 Portenta microcontroller.

### Implementation:
* Designed a real-time insect classification system based on LSTM network.
* Implemented the system on a dual-core H7 Portenta microcontroller.
* Applied signal processing techniques to acoustic microDoppler data.
* Utilized the M7 core for model deployment and the M4 core for data acquisition and preprocessing, demonstrating efficient inter-core communication.
