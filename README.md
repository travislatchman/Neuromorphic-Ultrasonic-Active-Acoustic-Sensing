# Neuromorphic-Ultrasonic-Active-Acoustic-Sensing

Description: This project aimed to create a simulated sensing system modeled after the highly efficient echolocation of the horseshoe bat. The system implemented a real-time insect classification system using an LSTM network on a dual-core H7 Portenta microcontroller. Developed an approach to classify different moth categories using a deep learning model implemented on a dual-core H7 Portenta microcontroller. The solution applies signal processing techniques to acoustic microDoppler data and utilizes an LSTM network for the classification task. The model is deployed on the M7 core while the M4 core handles data acquisition and preprocessing, demonstrating efficient inter-core communication. The systemâ€™s robust design accommodates real-time requirements, error handling, model updates, power management, and comprehensive debugging, making it a significant advancement in real-time insect classification using portable acoustic micro-Doppler systems.
